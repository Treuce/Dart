A Battleye Rcon Tool for Arma 2, Arma 3 and DayZ Standalone Servers.
Started updating the open-source program (Dart) with new functions for the Arma 2 Server UK 111. This repo will contain this entire project and pre-built application will be added once the program is stable.

I'm also working on a new framework for extended control over these Game Servers.

I do not expect to get any donations for this, but I'd be really grateful for it.
